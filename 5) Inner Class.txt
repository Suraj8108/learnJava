Inner Class
************************

	-> Java inner class or nested class is a class that is declared inside the class or interface.
	-> It can access all the members of the outer class, including private data members and methods.

There are three advantages of inner classes in Java. They are as follows:

	1) Nested classes represent a particular type of relationship that is it can access all the members (data members and methods) of 
	the outer class, including private.
	
	2) Nested classes are used to develop more readable and maintainable code because it logically group classes and interfaces
	in one place only.
	
	3) Code Optimization: It requires less code to write.

Example:

	class TestMemberOuter1{  
		private int data=30;  
		
		class Inner{  
			void msg(){System.out.println("data is "+data);}  
		}  
		
		public static void main(String args[]){  
			
			TestMemberOuter1 obj=new TestMemberOuter1();  	// Create object of outer class
			TestMemberOuter1.Inner in=obj.new Inner();  	// Create object of inner class
			in.msg();  
		
		}  
	}

Instantiate inner class
OuterClassReference.new MemberInnerClassConstructor();
