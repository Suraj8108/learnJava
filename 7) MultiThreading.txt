Demon Thread
Note: If you want to make a user thread as Daemon, it must not be started otherwise it will throw IllegalThreadStateException.


Garbage Collector:
The Garbage collector of JVM collects only those objects that are created by new keyword. So if you have created any object without new, 
you can use finalize method to perform cleanup processing (destroying remaining objects).

Garbage collection is performed by a daemon thread called Garbage Collector(GC). This thread calls the finalize() method before object 
is garbage collected.




Synchronization:
Java Synchronized Method
If you declare any method as synchronized, it is known as synchronized method.

Synchronized method is used to lock an object for any shared resource.

When a thread invokes a synchronized method, it automatically acquires the lock for that object and releases it when the 
thread completes its task.
